cmdline.py  is a simple command line interface for use with the dab library.
Rename the library "dablib.so" and add it to this folder, then run
   python3 cmdline.py 
with the parameters of your choice

Do not forget to enable PYTHON in the CMake file before generating a lib

To keep things a little simple, the Python version of the command line
implementation of DAB does not use all callbacks
