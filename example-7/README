Example 7 is the bluetooth controlled version of the cmdline version for dab.

It is derived from example 2, so for configuing see example 2.

===========================================================================
FEEL FREE TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM AND TO CONTRIBUTE
===========================================================================

The basic idea is that the program is started - as a server (for a single client
though).

The structure of the packages is simple a sequence of PACKET_SIZE bytes
   K L payload filler

where L is the length of the payload,
where K is the KEY, one on Q_GAIN, Q_CHANNEL and Q_SERVICE.
where payload is the data (0-terminated strings) to be carrier.

All three commands take a 0-terminated (i.e. C) string.

Q_GAIN string will set the gain of the connected device to the value "string" is a representation of, a value in the range 0 .. 100;

Q_CHANNEL string will set the frequency of the receiver to the frequency for
channel "string", - note that the setting of the Band cannot be done (yet?)
it is programmed in as a default.

Q_SERVICE string will select the service "string" in the current ensemble.
If no ensemble is detected, or the string is not recognized the behaviour
is not completely defined.

The program on its turn will send data out
in all cases the format of the message is
the same as for the receiving packages:
	K L payload filler

where the key (K) is one of Q_ENSEMBLE, Q_SERVICE_NAME, Q_TEXT_MESSAGE 
Q_PROGRAM_DATA.

the packet with key Q_ENSEMBLE is sent as an ensemble identifier is recognized
in the DAB stream. Each of the service identifiers is sent with a key
Q_SERVICE_NAME, text messages (i.e. the "dynamic label") is sent using
Q_TEXT_MESSAGE as key and some data describing the selected service (e.g.
length, startaddress, bitRate) is sent with Q_PROGRAM_DATA as key.

Two notes
a. Support for charactersets is limited (still work to be done)
b. the "client" is not implemented yet
