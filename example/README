As an example of how to use the dab-library, we present a program that
-together with the library - is a command line only version of the
dab software.

If/when you have installed the dab-library, and you have installed portaudio and libsamplerate, then 

mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make

should do the trick

The resulting program is dab-cmdline
