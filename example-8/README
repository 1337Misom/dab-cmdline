	T H I S  I S  W O R K  I N  P R O G R E S S


Example 7 is the bluetooth controlled version of the cmdline version for dab.

The "radio" device is embedded in a controller module, this controller
interfaces to bluetooth.

The UUID is temporarily chosen to be abcd

This embedded version will - for now - only work with the SDRplay device

The real work is in the development of a client, a simple Qt-based
version is in the "client" directory.

A java version is in development, a final version should be
runnable from an android phone
