simpleDab is a Qt interface to the DAB library. 
It is just an example program. Feel free to adapt (and
improve) it.

In the current version, one may select ONE device in the
configuration: just uncomment ONE of the lines
#CONFIG          += dabstick
CONFIG          += sdrplay
#CONFIG          += airspy
